# This is My end of Field Challenge.

##Simple Interface 09 = https://amazing-spence-228595.netlify.app (This assignment was great fun and feel like ive solidified my CSS in regards to Card/Grid, Also have a good understanding of the difference between margin and Padding now) Tried my best to match the font, for the dollar sign and number, proved to be quite difficult, Although, I believe it is quite close. )
